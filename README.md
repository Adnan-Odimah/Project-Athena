# Project Athena

to start this will be a method of learning and implementing features which I'd currently consider out of reach. In an attempt to achieve this, I have decided to implement each feature individually at first then link it all together with extended knowledge of NLP and async/multithreading. So this is a playground for how the different aspects of Athena will work before it all being implemented into one *AMAZING* personal assistant.

### CURRENTLY DOING:
Text classification and intent getting etc.

## I plan to add the following features first:
- Music Player ###DONE###
- Timers and Alarms and Reminders ###DONE###
- Grocery Tracking ## DONE ##
#TODO:
- Automation for desktop use (open chrome, watch this on youtube/netflix, etc.) ##  need to do playback 
- Habit Tracking/Building ## find a way to add reminders to actual program
- Project Tracking / management ## ADD USER specific?
- Weather
- Fact Checker (google etc.) 
- proper settings implementation to make it user friendly 
- Send Emails 
- Notification information 
- VSCode Voice commands 
- Make menu that shows when ur speaking to it, etc. maybe

## then:
- Make alarm repeating
- Trading bot aspect 
- Order food
- Journaling / notetaking
- Aid with financial decisions
- order something off amazon etc.
- Recipes and steps
- Coding assistant e.g. Im stuck on this... then it checks stack overflow etc. to assist you
- Smart home aspect
- Calendar Tracking/Organising
    - EXT: checks traffic and location. e.g. dentist is 30 minutes away, an hour before say be ready to leave in around 30 minutes for your dentist appointment

* legal Aspect
* Read ME

## Then:
- Holds conversations
- Tells jokes/sarcasm depending on the setting
- checks tone for mood (e.g. detects if your sad or happy)

## Finally:
- Implement into one program
- Add a physical body?
    * does groceries, helps with cooking/cleaning etc.
- Add Camera access
    * front door -> someone is at the front door (faceID? for previous guests, e.g. David is a the door)
    * Detection for threats (invasions/fires)
